# Defence-AI Bootcamp Repo

This is my setup, scratchpad, and learning ground for building my Defence-AI empire.

## What’s Here

- 🧠 GitHub, Git, VS Code setup
- 🗂️ Project folder structure
- 📜 `MISSION.md` — my vision doc
- 🔧 Placeholder for Python, OpenCV, and Drone Sim work

---

## Goal

To use this repo as my *journal of growth*, tracking my progress from Day 0 to prototype-ready defence tech builder.
